## What is JetForge

It is 3D print farm and business management software, designed for all sizes of 3D printing business (but on first hand keeping in mind garage businesses). It allows to import orders from Shopify and Etsy stores and to match automatically ordered items to files, keeping in mind printer models and materials. It calculates cost for each order taking into account material price, 3d printer hourly cost and energy consumption (using inexpensive zigbee smart power plugs). There's a huge roadmap including AI features, more storefront engines to support, material stock tracking and printer maintenance schedules. I'm will be happy to accept beta testers to checkout the software and give feedback. It's your exclusive opportunity to participate in product creation.
